      "Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.\n",
      "Mum?  Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.\n",
      "Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this!  Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!\n",

      "How can it? Both my parents are dead.\n",
      "Back again, Harry?  I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.\n",
      "So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?\n",
      "Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.\n",
      "I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\n",
      "This is light?\n",
      "Of course! Here it is! \"Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!\"\n",
      "The what?\n",
      "The what?\n",
      "Honestly, don't you two read? \"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\"\n",
      "Immortal?\n",
      "It means you'll never die.\n",
      "I know what it means!\n",
      "Shh!\n",
      "\"The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!\" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!\n",
      "Hagrid!\n",
      "Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.\n",
      "We know about the Philosopher's Stone!\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "We think Snape's trying to steal it.\n",
      "Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?\n",
      "Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.\n",
      "Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.\n",
      "Wait a minute.  One of the teachers?\n",
      "Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.\n",
      "That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.\n",
      "Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?\n",
      "That? It's a ... its um...\n",
      "I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?\n",
      "I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.\n",
      "Is that...a dragon?\n",
      "That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.\n",
      "Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert.\n",
      "Norbert?\n",
      "Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?\n",
      "Ha Ha.\n",
      "Don't you, Norbert?  Dededede.\n",
      "Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.  Who's that?\n",
      "Malfoy.\n",
      "Oh, dear.\n",
      "Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.\n",
      "It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.\n",
      "I don't understand. Is that bad?\n",
      "It's bad.\n",
      "Good evening.\n",
      "Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.\n",
      "50?!\n",
      "Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.\n",
      "Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...\"the four of us.\"\n",
      "No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.\n",
      "A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming.  You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.  A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?\n",
      "Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.\n",
      "Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.\n",
      "Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?  What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.\n",
      "Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.\n",
      "The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are......werewolves!\n",
      "There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that.  Nighty-night.\n",
      "Right. Let's go.\n",
      "Hagrid, what's that?\n",
      "What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something.  So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.\n",
      "Okay. Then I get Fang!\n",
      "Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward.\n",
      "You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.\n",
      "If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.\n",
      "Scared, Potter?!   Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.\n",
      "What is it, Fang?\n",
      "AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH!  HELP!!!!!\n",
      "Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.\n",
      "But what was that thing you saved me from?\n",
      "A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.\n",
      "But who would choose such a life?\n",
      "Can you think of no one?\n",
      "Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?\n",
      "Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\n",
      "The Philosopher's Stone.\n",
      "Harry!\n",
      "Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry?\n",
      "Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.\n",
      "You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?\n",
      "But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back.\n",
      "But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?\n",
      "I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.\n",
      "And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!\n",
      "Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?\n",
      "I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.\n",
      "Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?\n",
      "My scar. It keeps burning.\n",
      "It's happened before.\n",
      "Not like this.\n",
      "Perhaps you should see the nurse.\n",
      "I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh!  Oh. Of course!\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?  I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?  What did he look like?\n",
      "I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.\n",
      "The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.\n",
      "Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, \"After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.\"\n",
      "And did he seem interested in Fluffy?\n",
      "Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, \"The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.\"\n",
      "I shouldn't have told you that.  Where you going?! Wait!\n",
      "We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!\n",
      "I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.\n",
      "He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.\n",
      "How do you know\n",
      "Someone's going to try and steal it.\n",
      "I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly.\n",
      "That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.\n",
      "And with Dumbledore gone\n",
      "Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?\n",
      "Uh...we were just...\n",
      "You want to be careful. People will think you're  up to something.\n",
      "Now what do we do?\n",
      "We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.\n",
      "Trevor.\n",
      "Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!\n",
      "Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?\n",
      "Now, Neville, listen. We were\n",
      "No! I won't let you!  You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you.\n",
      "Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this... Petrificus Totalus.\n",
      "You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.\n",
      "Let's go.  Sorry.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "It's for your own good, you know.\n",
      "Ow! You stood on my foot!\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "Alohomora.\n",
      "Wait a minute...he's.... Sleeping.\n",
      "Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp.\n",
      "Uh. It's got horrible breath!\n",
      "We have to move its paw.\n",
      "What?!\n",
      "Come on!  Okay. Push!  I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign.  If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?\n",
      "The harp. It stopped playing.\n",
      "Ew! Yuck! Ugh.\n",
      "Jump! Go!\n",
      "Ahh!  Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.\n",
      "Whoa!  Oh. Ahh!\n",
      "Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.\n",
      "Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!\n",
      "Hermione!!\n",
      "Hermione!!\n",
      "Now what are we gonna do?!\n",
      "Just relax!\n",
      "Hermione! Where are you?!\n",
      "Do what I say. Trust me.\n",
      "Ahh! Harry!\n",
      "Harry!\n",
      "Are you okay?\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.\n",
      "Help!\n",
      "He's not relaxing, is he?\n",
      "Apparently not.\n",
      "Help! Help me!\n",
      "We've got to do something!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology.  Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,  it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!  Lumus Solem!\n",
      "Ahhh!\n",
      "Ron, are you okay?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!\n",
      "Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.\n",
      "What is that?\n",
      "I don't know. Sounds like wings.\n",
      "Curious. I've never seen birds like these.\n",
      "They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door.\n",
      "What's this all about?\n",
      "I don't know. Strange.\n",
      "Alohomora!  Well, it was worth a try.\n",
      "Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!\n",
      "We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.\n",
      "There! I see it!  The one with the broken wing!\n",
      "What's wrong, Harry?\n",
      "It's too simple.\n",
      "Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!\n",
      "This complicates things a bit!\n",
      "Catch the key!\n",
      "Hurry up!\n",
      "I don't like this. I don't like this at all.\n",
      "Where are we? A graveyard.\n",
      "This is no graveyard.  It's a chessboard.\n",
      "There's the door.\n",
      "Now what do we do?\n",
      "It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight.\n",
      "What happens now?\n",
      "Well, white moves first, and then...we play.\n",
      "Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?\n",
      "You there! D-5!  Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!\n",
      "Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.\n",
      "Wait a minute.\n",
      "You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.\n",
      "No, Ron! No!\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "He's going to sacrifice himself!\n",
      "No, Ron, you can't!  There must be another way!\n",
      "Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you.  Knight...to H-3.\n",
      "Check.\n",
      "Ahhhh!\n",
      "RON!  NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing.  Checkmate.  Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.\n",
      "You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.\n",
      "Not as good as you.\n",
      "Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.\n",
      "You?  No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one\n",
      "Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, \"p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?\"\n",
      "B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.\n",
      "No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.\n",
      "Snape was trying to...save me?\n",
      "I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.\n",
      "Th-then you let the troll in.\n",
      "Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone.  But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?\n",
      "Use the boy.\n",
      "Come here, Potter, now!\n",
      "Tell me. What do you see?\n",
      "What is it?! What do you see?!\n",
      "I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.\n",
      "He lies.\n",
      "Tell the truth! What do you see?!\n",
      "Let me speak to him.\n",
      "Master, you are not strong enough.\n",
      "I have strength enough for this.  Harry Potter. We meet again.\n",
      "Voldemort.\n",
      "Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!\n",
      "Stop him!  Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!\n",
      "Never!\n",
      "Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back.  All I ask for is something in return.  That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone!\n",
      "You liar!\n",
      "Kill him!\n",
      "Ahh! Ahh!  What is this magic?\n",
      "Fool! Get the stone!\n",
      "Ahhhhhhhhhh!\n",
      "Arrrhhhhhh!\n",
      "Ahhhhhhhhh!\n",
      "Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?\n",
      "Admirers?\n",
      "What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.  Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.\n",
      "Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?\n",
      "Fine. They're both just fine.\n",
      "But, what happened to the Stone?\n",
      "Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.\n",
      "But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?\n",
      "He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.\n",
      "How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...\n",
      "Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something.\n",
      "Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?\n",
      "Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "Love, Harry, love.  Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee... Mm. Alas. Earwax.\n",
      "All right there, Ron?\n",
      "All right? You?\n",
      "All right. Hermione?\n",
      "Never better.\n",
      "Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points.  Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points.  In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points.  And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.\n",
      "Whoo! Yeah!\n",
      "Nice one, Mate!\n",
      "Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award.  To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points.\n",
      "Good job.\n",
      "Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess  that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points.  And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points.\n",
      "We're tied with Slytherin!\n",
      "And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.\n",
      "Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order.  Gryffindor wins the House Cup!\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "Neville!\n",
      "Yeah! We won!!\n",
      "Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.\n",
      "Come on, Harry.\n",
      "One minute.\n",
      "Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja?  This is for you.\n",
      "Thanks, Hagrid.\n",
      "Oh. Go on...on with you.  Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.\n",
      "But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.\n",
      "I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh?  Off you go.\n",
      "Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?\n",
      "I'm not going home. Not really.\n"
